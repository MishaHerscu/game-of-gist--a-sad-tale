House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to a club and couldn't pay cover, so he flipped off the bouncer and that lead to some shit.

The bouncer was a dragon and he went to the dragon queen and she took care of Ned's triffling.

She made him stable boy for a week and sent Ned back to Winterfell with some pretty lame stories.
